GNU/Linux distribution versatile enough to suit any role. Development focuses
on simplicity, minimalism, and code elegance.

## Build notes

Arch Linux base image built from "scratch". This image is set to a snapshot
by using the archive.archlinux.org website for package updates, this is
required to reduce image size by preventing rolling updates to packages.

## Notes

This image includes [dumb-init](https://github.com/Yelp/dumb-init) to ensure a
clean shutdown and to correctly reap processes,
[Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/) is also installed to help monitor and
run child processes.
